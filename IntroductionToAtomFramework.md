# Introduction #

Atom framework for game developing in Java. Powered by JME3!


Better, more freedom, more fun!

From UDK and Unity 's battle field, I've dreamt about making even better game engine with the help of my 2 fav technologies - Java and opensource.

JME3 and Netbean combination are the most brighten idea I 've seen in years. I think it deserve a better reputation worldwide.
Initial Ideas:

  * Ease the learning curve
  * Fun play/create game like kids in a sandbox
  * Framework for games and apps(3D)
  * Nextgen techs

# Why call it Atom? #

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom

Yes, this is for game developing. But in its heart is future's technologies.

> Atom Etymology: Devive the thing as small as you can, than compose it into a thing again.

> The same in programming, after all, modulize is to be integrated again! That really is the core idea of Atom framework, use the most simple primitives to compose the bigger, bigger matter! Every where, small tiny, fastest, embed inside others, stick together well…Take a look in Atom Ex atomex, you will see the picture more clearly.

The most conceptual inspiration for Atom framework is project http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/index.htm . Unfortunately Ptolemy is in "for research only" area and its direction toward the much large scale than game developing. That's why Atom framework was born with the learnt architecture from Ptolemy.

> The Ptolemy project studies modeling, simulation, and design of concurrent, real-time, embedded systems. The focus is on assembly of concurrent components. The key underlying principle in the project is the use of well-defined models of computation that govern the interaction between components. A major problem area being addressed is the use of heterogeneous mixtures of models of computation

> Atom is designed to MAKE concurrent, real-time, embedded systems and GAMES. So it focus more in code generation, profile, monitoring; focus more in graphics, physics, player experience…etc. Underlying, it borrow quite a bunch of concept that built in Ptolemy.
