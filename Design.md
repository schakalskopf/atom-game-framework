# Atom Framework Design #

> This is the repository resulted of the design phase of Atom framework over years.
## Overview ##

In this page:

  * Goal of Atom framework - which tend to expand JME3 and Java language to suite more for game dev.
  * Problems of realtime applications (especially games).
  * Solutions and those base platforms, frameworks that we going to use to approach those goals.
  * Remain works and future vision

# Design goals #
## Overal goals ##

  * Flexible: Game | simulations centric but not forced!
  * Modular: Dependency injection along with Component injection
  * Parallel: Embrace parallel computing
  * Next gen: Come with Bleeding edge technologies and powers of Java languages
  * Cloud ready: Scale to web and distributed computing
  * With ease: GUI Tools everywhere, almost zero config need

## Additional goals ##

  * Minimum dependencies and their overlap
  * Small footprint
  * Efficient
